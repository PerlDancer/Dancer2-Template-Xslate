=head1 NAME

Dancer2::Template::Xslate - Text::Xslate template engine for Dancer2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<config.yaml>:

    template: Xslate

A Dancer 2 application:

    use Dancer2;

    get '/page/:number' => sub {
        my $page_num = params->{number};
        template "foo.tx", { page_num => $page_num };
    };

If you want to use cascading templates to manage page layouts
make sure you disable Dancer2 layouts.

In C<config.yaml>, comment the C<layout> keyword:

    # The default layout to use for your application (located in
    # views/layouts/main.tt)
    # layout: "main"

If you don't, Dancer2 will render your template and then render
the C<layout> template. If your layout template doesnt have the
C<content> placeholder only the layout HTML will be returned.
